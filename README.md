# SmartParking
Nowadays, it is difficult to find a parking space. So I said to myself: why not design a system that sends you directly to a free parking space. Then, every day we saw the high number of crimes committed against parked and unlit cars. At the same time, we also see how in some car parks the lighting is excessive, without the owner thinking about economy and resources.
