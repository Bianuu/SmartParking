# SmartParking
Nowadays, it's difficult to find a parking space. So I said to myself: why not design a system that sends you directly to a free parking space. Then, every day I saw the high number of crimes committed against parked and unlit cars. At the same time, I also saw how in some car parks the lighting is excessive, without the owner thinking about economy and resources.So I implemented using Ardunio this project.
